/**
 * Three FIFO ports are available:
 * - CFIFO
 * - D0FIFO
 * - D1FIFO
 *
 * Each FIFO port is configured with:
 * - A port register that handles the reading of data from the FIFO buffer and writing of
 * data to the FIFO buffer.
 * - A port select register that selects the pipe assigned to the FIFO port.
 * - A port control register.
 *
 * Each FIFO port has the following constraints:
 * - Access to the FIFO buffer for DCP control transfers is through the CFIFO port.
 * - Access to the FIFO buffer for DMA or DTC transfers is through the D0FIFO or D1FIFO port.
 * - The D0FIFO and D1FIFO ports can also be accessed by the CPU.
 * - When using functions specific to the FIFO port, such as the DMA or DTC transfer function,
 *   you cannot change the pipe number selected in the CURPIPE bits of the port select register.
 * - Registers configuring a FIFO port do not affect other FIFO ports.
 * - The same pipe must not be assigned to two or more FIFO ports.
 * - There are two FIFO buffer states, one giving access rights to the CPU and the other to the
 *   serial interface engine (SIE).  When the SIE has access rights, the FIFO buffer cannot be
 *   accessed by the CPU.
 *
 * FIFOPORT[15:0] bits
 * When the FIFOPORT bits are accessed, the USBFS reads the received data from the FIFO buffer
 * or writes the transmit data to the FIFO buffer.
 * The FIFO port register can be accessed only when the FRDY bit in the associated port control
 * register is 1.  The valid bits in the FIFO port register depend on the MBW and BIGEND settings
 * in the port select register.
